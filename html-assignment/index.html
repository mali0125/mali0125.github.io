            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Zarmeen Malik. I recently graduated from the University of Ottawa 
                with an Honours <abbr title="Bachelor of Science">BSc</abbr> in Biomedical 
                Science (French Immersion) and Minor in Psychology. Currently, I am enrolled 
                in the Interactive Media Design Program at Algonquin College. I am interested 
                in learning more about the IT field to expand my knowledge and skills. I would 
                also like to learn more about design, and take this opportunity to express
                creativity through my work.
            </p>

                is futile"</em> - Abu Bakr </blockquote>
            <p>There are various activities that I enjoy during my free time that also reflect 
                some of my interests. For instance, I like visual arts (sketching, colouring, 
                and painting), playing video games, learning Japanese, and reading comics/manga. 
                From my perspective, it is important to discover positive activities and interests 
                in order to become a more knowledgeable individual.
