            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is <em>Zarmeen Malik.</em> I recently graduated from the University of Ottawa 
                with an Honours <abbr title="Bachelor of Science">BSc</abbr> in Biomedical 
                Science (French Immersion) and Minor in Psychology. Currently, I am enrolled 
                in the Interactive Media Design Program at Algonquin College. I am interested 
                in learning more about the IT field to expand my knowledge and skills. I would 
                also like to learn more about design, and take this opportunity to express
                creativity through my work.
            </p>

                is futile" - <cite>Abu Bakr</cite></blockquote>
            <p>From my perspective, it is important to discover positive activities and interests 
                in order to become a more knowledgeable individual. As such, there are a variety of 
                activities that I enjoy during my free time that also reflect some of my interests. 
                For instance, some activities that I enjoy include:
            </p> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Visual Arts (sketching, colouring, and painting)</li>
                    <li>Playing video games</li>
                    <li>Learning Japanese</li>
                    <li>Reading comics/manga</li>
                </ul>
